[Fixed] Google Drive sync tags not readable: Tags show as IDs instead of names when syncing from another device. Root cause: (1) main.js missing `mergeTags: true` option when importing merged data during conflict resolution (line 1051), causing tag definitions to be dropped; (2) google-drive-sync.js `resolveConflicts()` not merging tags/note_tags/ai_conversations from remote data, only notes were merged. Fixed by adding merge options and implementing proper merging logic for all data types.
[Fixed] AI tag generation missing note title context: When generating tags, AI only received note content without the title, potentially resulting in less accurate tags. Fixed by passing note title to generateTags() in app.js (lines 2996, 4036) and including it in the AI prompt in ai.js (line 1910-1921). Now AI sees "Note Title: <title>" before analyzing content for better contextual tag suggestions.
[Fixed] CRITICAL: Deleted tags and AI conversations reappearing after Google Drive sync. Root cause: Merge logic in google-drive-sync.js (lines 755, 765, 775) and database.js (lines 1064, 1068, 1072) used Object.assign() which blindly restored all remote data, ignoring local deletions. Fixed by implementing smart merge that respects local deletions: only adds remote items if they exist locally or are actually used in notes. Local state is now the source of truth for deletions, preventing deleted data from being restored during sync.
[Fixed] CRITICAL: Offline edits could be lost during sync when remote has newer timestamp. Root cause: Conflict resolution only compared timestamps without checking if both devices edited since last sync. If Device A edited offline at 8 AM and Device B edited online at 8:30 AM, Device A's changes would be overwritten. Fixed in google-drive-sync.js (lines 728-749) by adding content-based conflict detection: when remote timestamp is newer but content differs and both versions changed since last sync, local version is preserved to prevent data loss. User can always access remote version from cloud.
[Fixed] CRITICAL: Offline-created notes deleted during sync due to using cloud's lastSync instead of device's lastSync. Root cause: google-drive-sync.js (line 582) used Math.max(providedLastSync, internalLastSync), taking cloud's global lastSync from other devices. If Device A (last sync 7 AM) created note at 8 AM offline, and Device B synced at 8:30 AM, Device A's note would be treated as "deleted" (8 AM < 8:30 AM cloud sync). Fixed by using ONLY device-specific lastSync (line 583-584), ensuring notes created after this device's last sync are never treated as deletions, preventing catastrophic data loss.
