[Fixed]: Bugs has been squashed

1. [Fixed] "Note saved successfully" notification when Auto save is on is too aggresive. How to make this more subtle?
2. [Fixed] Loading screen is not consistent. For example, some times it shows "Preparing to restore backup" when it should be "Processing with AI" vice versa.
3. [Fixed] "Note saved successfully" notification keeps popping up when pressing Undo/Redo while autosave is on.
