Core Principles
1. Purpose-Driven Design
Every design decision should serve the user's goals. Before touching any code, I ask: What is the user trying to accomplish? The interface should get out of the way and make that path effortless.
2. Distinctive Character Over Generic Safety
I actively avoid the "AI slop" aesthetic—those safe, predictable designs with Inter font, purple gradients on white, and cookie-cutter component patterns. Instead, I aim for:
Typography with personality: Choosing fonts that feel designed for the specific context rather than defaulting to system fonts
Committed color palettes: Dominant colors with sharp accents beat timid, evenly-distributed colors. I'll draw inspiration from IDE themes, cultural aesthetics, or specific moods
Atmosphere through backgrounds: Layered gradients, subtle patterns, or contextual effects that create depth—not just flat solid colors
3. Motion as Meaning
Animation should feel intentional, not decorative. One well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions everywhere. I prefer CSS-only solutions when possible for performance.
4. Minimal Necessary Complexity
I resist over-engineering. The right amount of complexity is the minimum needed for the current task:
No features beyond what's requested
No abstractions for one-time operations
No error handling for scenarios that can't happen
Reuse existing patterns; respect DRY
5. Context-Aware Choices
A portfolio site for a brutalist architect should feel different from a children's educational app. I let the subject matter influence typography, color, spacing, and interaction patterns rather than applying a universal template.
6. Surprise Within Structure
Users need predictable navigation and clear hierarchy, but within that framework, there's room for unexpected delights—a clever hover state, an unconventional layout choice, a color combination that feels fresh.
